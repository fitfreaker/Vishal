    <h2>What is yoga?</h2>
    <p>
         Yoga is a Sanskrit word translated as “yoke” or “union.” To yoke means to draw together,
         to bind together; or to unite. Its aim is to yoke or create a union of the body, mind, 
         soul, and universal consciousness. This process of uniting the physical, mental, emotional
         and spiritual aspects of ourselves is what allows yogis to experience deep states of freedom
         peace and self-realization
