    <h2>What Is Cardio?</h2>
    <p>Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity
       that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone. This is the zone where you burn 
       the most fat and calories.</p>

       <h2>Benefits of Cardio</h2>
 <ol>
       <li> There are very few activities you can do for a short period of time that have all of the physical
            and mental health benefits that cardio exercise offers. Some of the known benefits 
            of cardio include:
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhances sleep quality, especially if the exercise is moderate to vigorous in intensity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Burns fat and calories, making it easier to lose weight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improves your sex life by increasing your body's ability to become aroused, improving your body 
             and even potentially helping to treat medication-related sexual dysfunction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Promotes feeling good, and can even help relieve depression5 and anxiety.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improves confidence in how you look and feel.
        </li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Guidelines for Cardio Frequency</h2>
 <p>The frequency of your workouts will depend on your fitness level and your schedule.
     The basic guidelines are:</p>
 <ul>
    
        <li>
            For general health, try moderately-intense cardio 30 minutes a day,
            5 days a week, or vigorously intense cardio for 20 minutes a day, 3 days a week. 
            You can also do a mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            For weight loss and/or to avoid regaining weight, you may need to do more than 
            300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to meet your goals.
        </li>
        <li>
            To maintain a healthy body weight, you need about 150 to 300 minutes of
            moderate-intensity activity a week.
        </li>
 </ul>
