                    <p>Cardio is defined as any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up and keeps
                         it up for a prolonged period of time. Your respiratory system will start 
                         working harder as you begin to breathe faster and more deeply. Your blood
                          vessels will expand to bring more oxygen to your muscles, and your body 
                          will release natural painkillers (endorphins).
                          The physical and mental benefits of this type of exercise are seemingly endless.
