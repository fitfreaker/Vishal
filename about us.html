          <h3>Begninnig</h3>
          <p>
            The fact of being under-weight came to my realization in 1999 when I
            was in my 10th grade and I decided to work upon it. I decided to
            build an impressive personality and groom myself. My school coach
            guided me with several sessions of outdoor training. However, I
            realized the need of joining gym as the physical fitness regime that
            I was following was not sufficient for my requirement. The hostel
            did not have the provision and I decided to came back to my
            hometown, Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) where I pursued further studies
            and started exercises in gym. After one year of training, I could
            see a significant improvement in my physique and my coach suggested
            me to compete in a gym competition which I won. This was when I
            became passionate about bodybuilding and decided to pursue it on a
            professional level. I became more addicted and dedicated and bagged
            the title of Mr. Saharanpur in 2001 and my journey of being an
            athlete started from there.

          <h3>Mr. Asia</h3>
          <p>
            I also wanted to be independent and earn a living on my own and
            hence started working as a gym trainer. Due to limited exposure. I
            left my home town and moved to a better city nearby and continued as
            a gym trainer. In 2004, I bagged the prestigious title of Junior Mr.
            India and my preparations for further competitions went on. In 2005,
            life took a turn and while preparing for Asia championship I got
            severely injured. My back vertebrae had ruptured and this had caused
            nerve injuries due to which I had paralyzed my right hand and leg by
            about 30 percent. I was bedridden for months and my bodybuilding
            career which had just started had taken a halt for 3 years.

          <h3>My Team</h3>
          <p>
            Genuine enthusiasm is highly desirable for trainers. They should
            know the ways to maintain a passion for their work, keep their heart
            and mind open, and deeply care about the results of training. As Roy
            Pollock puts it, an effective trainer is one who genuinely cares
            about his or her learners' success.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Trainer, you will be responsible for gauging the training needs
            of individuals and teams, onboarding new talent, preparing
            presentations and teaching materials, ensuring trainee safety, and
            conducting feedback surveys to assess the effectiveness of
            educational programmes.
