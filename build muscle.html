    <p>
    Patience is overrated, especially in the weight room   and the kitchen, when there's 
    typically a specific desired outcome for athletes : figuring out how to build muscle.
    Sure, change takes time. But if you’re trying to find the fastest way to build muscle
    and aren’t seeing obvious size increases from month to month, it’s a sign hm that your 
    approach is off.
    And a workout is a terrible thing to waste. Plus, even if you are seeing progress, that 
    there’s no reason you can’t strive to see more muscular gains.</p>

      <h2>1. Increase Your Training Volume</h2>
    <p> 
    Training volume — your number of reps multiplied by your number of sets — is a primary 
    of hypertrophy (muscle volume growth).And to increase volume, you may actually need to 
    go lower in weight than you might guess.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Focus on the Eccentric Phase</h2>
    <p>When lifting any weight, you will have a concentric (agonist muscle contracting) and
       eccentric  (agonist muscle lengthening) phase. For instance, as you lower into a squat, 
       you’re performing an eccentric action. When you return to standing, that’s concentric.
       And, according to research published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, 
       eccentric work is far better at triggering hypertrophy.</p>

    <h2>3. Decrease Between-Set Rest Intervals</h2>
    <p>If you touch your phone between exercise sets, it better be to set its timer to 30 to 90 seconds.
       When lifting for hypertrophy, rest periods of 30 to 90 seconds encourage a that os body that cona 
       quick release in muscle-building hormones (including testosterone and human growth hormone) 
       while also making sure that you really, truly fatigue your muscles, according to Fitzgerald.</p>

    <h2>4. To Grow Muscle, Eat More Protein</h2>
    <p>Strength training breaks down your muscles, and protein builds them back up. 
        The more difficult your lifting workouts are, the more important muscle-building 
        foods become when weighing protein intake to solidify recovery, Fitzgerald explains.</p>

    <h2>5. Focus on Calorie Surpluses, Not Deficits </h2>
    <p>This can be a hard one to get used to, especially for those who are used to counting
         calories in the hopes of shredding fat. But when it comes to how to gain muscle mass
          fast (that means weight gained, not lost), you need to consume more calories than you burn each day.</p>

    <h2>6. Get More Sleep</h2>
    <p>Muscle recovery requires more than the right nutrition. It takes time — roughly 
        eight hours per night — dedicated to recovery, Fitzgerald says. After all, when you sleep,
         your body releases human growth hormone, which helps grow muscle and keeps
          levels of the stress hormone cortisol in check.
